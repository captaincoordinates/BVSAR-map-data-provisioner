General
- driver modules define specific process and not everything is configurable
    - small number of features are configurable
- 'sources' conform to a pattern where standard input & output

Data Sources
- Canvec WMS
- BC DEM -> Hillshade
- Google / Bing
    - if URL provided, otherwise Canvec all the way down
- Resource Roads
- Trails
    - integrate from InReach
    - check BVSAR KML for non-duplicates
- Cabins
- Transmission Lines
    - only when overlaid on non-Canvec, as Canvec already shows transmission lines

    Possible Data Sources
    - Look for data on old mining roads
    - Snowmobile club trails
    - Google Earth's peaks

Approach Notes
- All source files downloaded to common location and in common grid
    - For Canvec count grids at scale and CRS from 0,0 and name accordingly
- Source data grouped into directories showing year of acquisition
- Outlines of cached areas should be visible at zoom-level 1
- SARM team wants logging roads / trails visible at more zoom levels
- Generated content (from tilemill and merged Google / Bing) always generated fresh, overwrite existing

Hosting
- Raspberry Pi should only require 1.2A if no peripherals
- Battery pack may be more reliable / simpler than car charger with UPS
    - check how much battery power can be expected
    - webpage could show remaining battery
    - e.g. Pi Juice
- Ruggedised case could be appropriate
- External wifi antenna may be necessary for a good signal when broadcasting

HTTP
- expand on heuristics to periodically check if we still have the optimal concurrency
- attempt to accommodate 429 "too many requests"
