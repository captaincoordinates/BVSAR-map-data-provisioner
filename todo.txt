- xyz (no plus) profile
- add waterways and wetlands to xyzplus
    - need lighter blue for lines
    - some problem with bbox clip for waterways - does not match over layers bbox clip (in different CRS)
- os-specific conda environment files
- browser-based tile viewer
    - integrate viewer build into httpd image using multi-stage build and node image
        - node setup may have more success if using package.json, create with npm init
    - ** fix directory selection issue
- file sharing via httpd
- refuse to run if annual data is not updated
- WMS retriever should use separate types for ImageRequirement and PartialCoverageTile as they are different things
- need some consistency in class file names, classes having their own files
- black / isort
- only provision grid squares intersecting the drawn area to avoid filling unwanted gaps

- generally poor approach to managing merging & edge detection - lots of assumptions in there about what the profile does
    - would be nice to better encapsulate merge / edge logic in profile
