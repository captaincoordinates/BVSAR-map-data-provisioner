Data Sources
- Resource Roads
- Trails
    - integrate from InReach
    - check BVSAR KML for non-duplicates
- Cabins
- Transmission Lines
    - only when overlaid on non-Canvec, as Canvec already shows transmission lines
- ATES terrain (check impact on vis)

    Possible Data Sources
    - Look for data on old mining roads
    - Snowmobile club trails
    - Google Earth's peaks

Approach Notes
    Priorities
    - accept input bounds with standard schema and divide into sequential jobs
    - update logging to specify which job of how many
    - report progress on tile merge
    - maintain output bounds
    - improve data collection
        - get resource roads, transmission lines from default location, get hiking trails & shelters from a configured location and OK if missing, same with ATES

- add validator to ensure zoom_max >= zoom_min and same for zoom_xyz_*
- automate attribute removal for resource roads to only what's required - see if data volume reduction is worth it
- test http://maps.geogratis.gc.ca/wms/elevation_en
- Extend polygon to include Sibolas
- Cover 5km either side of hwy 37
- Review covered areas with SAR team
- Source data grouped into directories showing year of acquisition
- WMS retriever should use separate types for ImageRequirement and PartialCoverageTile as they are different things
- need some consistency in class file names, classes having their own files
- combined util.py and file.py and choose better home for util

Bugs
- BBOX validation fails in a strange way

Hosting
- Raspberry Pi should only require 1.2A if no peripherals
- Battery pack may be more reliable / simpler than car charger with UPS
    - check how much battery power can be expected
    - webpage could show remaining battery
    - e.g. Pi Juice
- Ruggedised case could be appropriate
- External wifi antenna may be necessary for a good signal when broadcasting

HTTP
- expand on heuristics to periodically check if we still have the optimal concurrency
- attempt to accommodate 429 "too many requests"
