Priorities
    - HEAD validation of finished product
    - more appropriate logging
    - merge all output areas in separate layer - main store is not kml, only merge is kml

- HTTP Retriever
    - expand on heuristics to periodically check if we still have the optimal concurrency
    - attempt to accommodate 429 "too many requests"
    - make repeated attempts with extending wait period and error if not all requests satisfied
- refuse to run in annual data is not updated
- add validator to ensure zoom_max >= zoom_min and same for zoom_xyz_*
- Review covered areas with SAR team
- Source data grouped into directories showing year of acquisition
- WMS retriever should use separate types for ImageRequirement and PartialCoverageTile as they are different things
- need some consistency in class file names, classes having their own files
- combined util.py and file.py and choose better home for util

Bugs
- BBOX validation fails in a strange way

Hosting
- Raspberry Pi should only require 1.2A if no peripherals
- Battery pack may be more reliable / simpler than car charger with UPS
    - check how much battery power can be expected
    - webpage could show remaining battery
    - e.g. Pi Juice
- Ruggedised case could be appropriate
- External wifi antenna may be necessary for a good signal when broadcasting
