- xyzplus-winter profile (xyzplus without water info and with avi zones. Only zones and avalanche paths?) Ensure zones are at the bottom of the layer stack
- xyz (no plus) profile
    - needs refactor to make logic specific to profiles, not driver working around profile attributes
- remove BVSAR-map-data-runner and put docker-compose in main project
- os-specific conda environment files
- browser-based tile viewer
    - integrate viewer build into httpd image using multi-stage build and node image
        - node setup may have more success if using package.json, create with npm init
    - ** fix directory selection issue
- file sharing via httpd
- refuse to run if annual data is not updated
- WMS retriever should use separate types for ImageRequirement and PartialCoverageTile as they are different things
- need some consistency in class file names, classes having their own files
- black / isort
- only provision grid squares intersecting the drawn area to avoid filling unwanted gaps
- auto-push to Docker Hub from master if test succeeds
