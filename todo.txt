- merge all output areas in separate layer - main store is not kml, only merge is kml
- HTTP Retriever
    - use async http?
    - expand on heuristics to periodically check if we still have the optimal concurrency
    - attempt to accommodate 429 "too many requests"
    - make repeated attempts with extending wait period and error if not all requests satisfied
- browser-based tile viewer
- refuse to run in annual data is not updated
- Review covered areas with SAR team
- Source data grouped into directories showing year of acquisition

    - webpage could show remaining battery
    - e.g. Pi Juice
