SAR Priorities
- make image names better - use geographic data so it's obvious if they cover the same area
- why is container not recognising pre-existing files?
- configuration can exclude tiling then job just finishes after data download
- Once done, can
    - WMS for all BVSAR area (canvec, transmission)
    - crop hillshading / slope to BVSAR area
    - manually build tilemill and initiate export

Entry Point
- truncate bbox values to reasonable precision
- additional parameter could have create, replace, continue and determines what happens if the provisioning has already occurred
- allow path to .yaml file, validated against a .yaml schema
- allow user args to override .yaml properties, ultimately everything merged to a single 'sourceConfig', no 'userArgs',
    - how will this affect the validators?
- md5 hash of all arguments after soure yaml and user args combined, instead of base64 or user args

WMS TIle Provisioner
- check is_projected() in CRS
- lower priority: am I naming the images incorrectly according to x / y position?

TIFF Provisioner
- permit optional bounds in case you don't want to use all .tiff files as bbox
    - test with DEM

HTTP
- expand on heuristics to periodically check if we still have the optimal concurrency
- attempt to accommodate 429 "too many requests"
- exclude "file already exists" scenario from concurrency test, e.g. first filter requests to only files that do not exist

Export
- everything not a provisioner (e.g. the export manager should be ignorant of source / user configuration. It should accept source-agnostic parameters and not name them to indicate otherwise)
- dependency on scales / zooms object requires jumping through hoops in tiff provisioner, would be good to remove this
- would be good to check for in-progress exports before proceeding, can we determine if the same export is already in progress?
- seems like sometimes export will use pre-existing output, e.g. "[tilemill] [tilemill-ui] found previous export with same name, so renamed to: truview_LTEyMy4xNzI5NTk0OS4xOTA5MDUtMTIyLjk5MDE0MDQ5LjMzOTc3OA_bea4cd.mbtiles"

Style
- see if it's a good idea to be using dictionaries over objects
- similarly, list vs array vs tuple
- ensure _ prefix on private functions
- look for remaining \ line endings
