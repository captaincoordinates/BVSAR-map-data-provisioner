Entry Point
- truncate bbox values to reasonable precision
- additional parameter could have create, replace, continue and determines what happens if the provisioning has already occurred
- allow path to .yaml file, validated against a .yaml schema
- allow user args to override .yaml properties, ultimately everything merged to a single 'sourceConfig', no 'userArgs'

WMS TIle Provisioner
- check is_projected() in CRS
- is it possible to calculate both axes in one block, but then still do grid-filling? 

HTTP
- build some heuristics to find the optimal concurrent request count (with a defined or default limit, e.g. 8)

Style
- see if it's a good idea to be using dictionaries over objects
- similarly, list vs array vs tuple
- ensure _ prefix on private functions
- look for remaining \ line endings
